It's main website of ZSO10 App.
Temporarly it's just generated by GitHub, but in future it's gonna be
more sophisticated (probably PHP based).

# Documentation
It's also place for code documentation. It's based directly on `master`
branch of subproject's source files and autogenerated daily at
03:00 AM (Europe/Warsaw) on my (@MarPiRK) server.

If anyone is interested in script, which I'm using to generate docs,
feel free to get in touch with me.
